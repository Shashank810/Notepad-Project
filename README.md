# How to run the code
Clone the repository and run the code in QT creater. Then after running it, a basic notepad will open.

# What has been done
1. I have created this software I have used QT creater software.
2. I have created a basic notepad with basic features like bold, unbold, superscript and subscript.
3. All features are on toolbar and also listed in 'Format' section.
4. To build this I have taken help of [blackbox.ai](https://www.blackbox.ai/).

# Features
1. Bold - To bold the text select the text and click on 'B' on taskbar.
2. Unbold - To unbold the text delect the bold text and then click the 'B' symbol again.
3. Superscript - To apply superscript select the text and click on the superscript symbol.
4. Subscript - To apply subscript select the text and click on the subscript symbol.

# Issues/Challenges
1. This was my first time using QT creater software therefore I have faced difficulties in getting use to it. For that I have taken help from Youtube tutorials and Blackbox.ai.
2. I was not very used to for using OOPs concept in real life software therefore I have faced issue inthat too.
